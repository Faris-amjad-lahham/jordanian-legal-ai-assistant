    "# 🧠 Legal Assistant – Jordanian Labour Law Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📌 Overview\n",
    "This notebook implements a **Legal Assistant chatbot** focused on the **Jordanian Labour Law (Law No. 8 of 1996)**.  \n",
    "The system is designed to ingest legal articles, clean and validate them, chunk the text, and prepare it for **LLM-based question answering** in a safe and structured manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "⚠️ **Disclaimer**  \n",
    "This system generates **informational legal drafts and summaries only**.  \n",
    "It does **NOT provide legal advice** and does **NOT replace a licensed lawyer**.  \n",
    "Any generated contract, answer, or explanation is a **non-binding draft** and must be reviewed by a qualified legal professional before use.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🎯 Objectives\n",
    "- Convert raw labour law text into structured JSON\n",
    "- Validate article integrity and detect domain-level gaps\n",
    "- Chunk legal text for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)\n",
    "- Prepare clean and traceable inputs for a legal chatbot\n",
    "- Ensure every chunk can be traced back to its legal source\n",

    "## 🧱 Notebook Pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1️⃣ Data Ingestion\n",
    "The notebook loads the Jordanian Labour Law articles from a structured JSON file.  \n",
    "Each record contains an `article_number` and the full legal `text`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```json\n",
    "{\n",
    "  \"article_number\": \"15\",\n",
    "  \"text\": \"Article (15): Employment Contract Preparation...\"\n",
    "}\n",
    "2️⃣ Text Cleaning\n",
    "Minimal preprocessing is applied to preserve legal meaning:\n",
    "1_Normalize whitespace and line breaks\n",
    "2_Remove OCR artifacts and duplicated spacing\n",
    "3_Preserve original legal wording (no paraphrasing)\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "Before:\n",
    "Article (15):   Employment   Contract   Preparation\n",
    "After:\n",
    "Article (15): Employment Contract Preparation\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3️⃣ Chunking Strategy\n",
    "Long legal articles are split into smaller semantic chunks to improve:\n",
    "\n",
    "1_Retrieval accuracy\n",
    "2_Context window efficiency for LLMs\n",
    "3_Precise legal referencing\n",
    "*Each chunk includes*:\n",
    "\n",
    "1_article_number\n",
    "2_chunk_id\n",
    "3_text\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "{\n",
    "  \"article_number\": \"15\",\n",
    "  \"chunk_id\": \"15_2\",\n",
    "  \"text\": \"If the work contract is for a definite period...\"\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "4️⃣ Validation & Sanity Checks\n",
    "A sanity report is automatically generated to validate dataset quality:\n",
    "\n",
    "1_Total number of extracted articles\n",
    "2_Detected gaps in article numbering due to legal amendments\n",
    "3_Chunk size distribution\n",
    "Data consistency checks\n",
    "The output is saved as:\n",
    "sanity_report.json\n",
    "This ensures the dataset reflects real legislative structure, not artificial completeness.\n",
    "5️⃣ LLM Readiness\n",
    "The final processed dataset is optimized for:\n",
    "Legal question-answering chatbots\n",
    "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)\n",
    "Draft contract and legal explanation generation\n",
    "Example chatbot query:\n",
    "“Can an employer terminate a limited employment contract early?”\n",
    "The system retrieves the relevant article(s) and generates an answer with explicit legal grounding.\n",
    "🚀 End Goal\n",
    "\n",
    "To build a safe, explainable, and auditable Legal Assistant system that:\n",
    "Understands Jordanian Labour Law\n",
    "Provides grounded answers with article references\n",
    "Produces draft-only legal outputs with clear disclaimers\n",
    "Supports future export to Word / PDF contract templates"
