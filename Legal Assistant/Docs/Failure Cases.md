# Failure Cases

## Legal Question Answering
- If no relevant legal article is found, the system states that the information is not available.
- The system does not guess or generate unsupported legal content.

## Contract Drafting
- If required information is missing, the contract may be incomplete.
- The contract is always marked as non-binding to avoid misuse.
